Mother of dragons, among other things.
I don’t regret being a working mother when I can show others that I can fulfill my dreams, and so does my children.
I cannot settle for just anything. My kids are watching!
No influence is as powerful as a mother.
I have the best job in the world, I’m a mom.
Nurturing, supporting, and helping my children grow.
Who runs the world? Moms.
Being a mom doesn’t mean you’re superwoman. It just means you’re more powerful than you ever thought possible.
Probably drinking coffee because I’m a mom.
Inspiring people to cook, eat & live well.
How you can live the high life if you don’t wear high heels.
Fashion is about comfort and feeling good.
Happiness looks beautiful on you.
Style shows your attitude.
We can feel and see everything in clothes.
We can express our feelings through our clothes.
Never over or under dressed, just dressed.
We all have style; we only have to find it.
Style is nothing but what we choose.
Dress-up is still my favorite past time.
Born to express, not impress.
I got here by being me, so I’ll continue being me.
You couldn’t handle me even if I came with instructions.
Kilometers are shorter than miles. To save gas I’ll take my next trip in kilometers.
I’m out here hustlin’ to claim what’s mine.
I’d rather be hated for who I am than loved for who I am not
I don’t care what people think of me. This is me in the rawest form.
Risk taker. Adventurer. Globetrotter. Living my dreams.
Be all in or get out. There is no in-between.
I might not be where I want to be yet but I get closer every day.
